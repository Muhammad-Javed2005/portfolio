You are a senior frontend developer.

I already have a working static portfolio website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript only).
I want you to UPDATE and RESTRUCTURE it according to the instructions below.
Do NOT change the overall theme, colors, or styling concept.
Only improve layout structure and content.

IMPORTANT:
- Use ONLY HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript
- No frameworks, no libraries, no Tailwind, no React
- Keep everything static
- Modify existing files (index.html, style.css, script.js)

====================================
SKILLS SECTION (MAJOR UPDATE)
====================================
Current issue:
Skills are shown in multiple small boxes.

What I want instead:
- ONE ROW = ONE SKILL CATEGORY
- Each row should contain:
  1) Category Icon (logo)
  2) Category Title
  3) Skills list
  4) 2–3 professional sentences description

Layout example (one row each):
------------------------------------------------
[ ICON ]  Programming Languages
C++, Java, Python
Short paragraph (2–3 lines) explaining my programming foundation,
problem-solving skills, and OOP experience.
------------------------------------------------

Skill categories to include (each as ONE ROW):
1) Programming Languages
2) Data Analysis & Visualization
3) Machine Learning
4) Deep Learning
5) NLP & Computer Vision

Each category MUST have:
- Relevant icon
- Skills badges or inline list
- 2–3 professional sentences explaining expertise

====================================
PROJECTS SECTION (CONTENT IMPROVEMENT)
====================================
- Keep ONE PROJECT per row (full width)
- Increase project description length (3–4 lines)
- Add more technical explanation:
  - What problem it solves
  - Tools/technologies used
  - Outcome or impact

Each project row must include:
- Project title
- Detailed description
- GitHub button
- Optional Live Demo button

Projects:
1) Brain Tumor Detection using CNN
2) Fake News Detection
3) Job Market Trend Monitor

====================================
PROFILE PICTURE (NEW ADDITION)
====================================
- Add a professional profile image in the Hero section
- Circular or soft-rounded style
- Slight shadow or glow
- Image file name: profile.jpg
- Assume profile.jpg exists in the project root or images folder

====================================
RESUME SECTION (NEW SECTION)
====================================
Add a new section similar to Skills and Education:

Section title: Resume

Content:
- Short professional summary text
- A prominent button:
  "Download Resume (PDF)"

Resume file:
- File name: Resume_Javed.pdf
- Must download directly on click
- Assume Resume_Javed.pdf is already placed in project folder

====================================
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
====================================
- Maintain current dark, modern UI
- Keep animations and hover effects
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Clean spacing and alignment
- Professional, recruiter-friendly wording

====================================
OUTPUT
====================================
Update:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js

Do not remove existing working features.
Only restructure skills, enhance projects, and add profile picture + resume section.
